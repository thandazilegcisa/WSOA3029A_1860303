              Exam Graph
            </h2>
          </header>
          <br />
          <p>
            For my Exam Graph i chose to use a new data set - sourced from the
            world population index website, population data and relate that data
            to the air quality that we see from the cities used throughout the
            website. Although for this graph i was particularly interested in
            examining the global south's relationship in this regard. And some
            of the findings were very interesting and suprising to learn.
            <br />
            <br /><p>
            In Blog number 6 we discussed the various factors that contribute to
            global warming and thus a cities air quality index, and one of the
            highest emission activities was, vehicles. And the larger a cities
            population the more vehicles potentially on the road. These two
            variables in my opinion have a direct correlation to each other
            because of this reason. The population data retrieved is not
            particularly live data, instead it is static. I found this
            reasonable to use because population data would understandably, be
            tricky to compute live. Hence, i have downloaded json files sourced
            from the world population website - in the file is past and future
            (predicted) population statistics from the year 1950 to 2035. I
            opted for this because i could not find a resource that feeds live
            updates of specific cities instead of the general world population
            (which is the only live data set i found, in relation to population)
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 class="aboutArticle-Header">What can be learnt from this new data set?</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
            Its not very clear what can be learnt from this because, my initial assumption was
            that in the case of Lagos, because i knew that it has very high volumes of population 
            density, but at the time that i write this reflection
            (because the air quality fluctuates throughout the day)Lagos's air quality index is 
            considerably (lower) which means better than Accra's air quality which has the highest index 
            but lowest population. So thats a major suprise to me. However, what makes sense is that 
            Johannesburg being the most densely populated city in South Africa, currently has the worst 
            air quality. Which makes sense because more people means more vehicles, electricity usage, and 
            generally more footprint on the environment. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="aboutArticle-Header">Where is my Data-Driven Art?</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
            There is not Data-Driven Art, because of the fact that i chose not to focus much on it 
            mainly because i wanted to hone in on the design of the overall website in terms of the typography, user interface, 
            user experience, colour palette, fonts and the like. More information on this on the about page.
