            Plotting and Rendering the graph was very fun, however i came across
            a very steep problem when i attempted to link my visualisations with
            data. I found that i was unable to successfully fetch and return
            data as a result of a "CORS" error. Therefore, i was unable to
            retrieve data from the api. However, i did try to hard code some
            example data in myself just to gain an understanding of how plotting
            and rendering works. So i made an array of random stats that are not
            exactly from the api.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I even tried a second api, but encountered the same problem and
            error while trying to retrieve data. So i opted to stick with the
            Superhero Api because while i cannot retrieve the data myself, in my
            development environment, the site is able to handle requests and
            upon making a simple id search i am able to retrieve data from the
            site itself in JSON format. Therefore if this "CORS" error persists
            and consequently cannot find a solution. I will use the JSON
            requested and retrieved from the site, make a json file, paste it
            into the file and use the file to fetch data.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Therefore, for now the graphs are made up of an arrays populated by
            myself just for the purposes of indicating that i am confident in
            the fact that i know how draw and link the data with javascript.
            Hence, i do not have much to say about the findings of the data,
            besides the fact that the way i wanted to layout my data was so that
            they contrast each other by one being on the left and the other on
            the right, and as you can see the second graph did not turn out how
            i would've liked. Will Continue to work on the graphs though!
