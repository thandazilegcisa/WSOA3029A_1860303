          The following data sets aim to compare and contrast the air qualities

            After having to scrap and change my desired Api. I went back to my
            initial idea of using visualisation to bring attention to climate
            change. These visualisations speak to climate change through the
            lens of measuring the air quality index of major economic centers
            around the world.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I chose these particular cities because they are all pivitol to the
            economies of each country. As such because these are major economic
            hubs, it means that a significant sum of urbanisation takes place in
            these cities. This is an important factor to consider because
            despite the fact that major cite are usually not home to fossil fuel
            irrigation plants, humans and their population still have an adverse
            effect on how sustainable a place can be to live in. Examples,
            include the fact that there are more cars in cities than not, this
            means that major cities are more likey to have bad air quality.
            There are usually not a significant sum of trees in major cities
            with expection to cities like signapore, taiwan and even
            Johannesburg.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Although, despite the amount of trees Johannesburg has, it is still
            clouded by sometimes thick clouds of bad quality air. And my graph
            is an indication of exactly that. Which comes as no suprise to me
            considering Johannesburg is the city of "gold", and so mines either
            of current or of the past have severly contributed to the decline in
            air quality, along with being the most densly populated city in
            South Africa.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            And when you compare Beijing (China) and New York (USA) they are
            largely on the same level of air quality, with china bing slightly
            higher. This results are therefore, emblematic of th narrative that
            i seek to potray with these visualisations and because this is a
            drastic change from the api that i attempted to use i feel much more
            confident in creating my visualisations because this data set has
            allowed me to decide on a very tangible narrative. And because i
            made the graph with the intention to be strictly communcative, I
            made sure to only add crucial information - like the bars, names of
            cities, and a simplified axis. However it would be helpful to label
            the axis for the next submission.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To, conclude i do not have any added interaction to the graphs as
            yet this is largely due to the fact that i had problems with my
            previous api and so my aim for the project was to firstly change the
            api and come up with a thoughtful narrative. So adding interaction
            to the graphs is something that i will focus on in my next and final
            submission. But now that i have a solid narrative in consideration i
            will be better able to add interaction for meaning and also make a
            differnt graph because my graphs are currently the same because i
            was also more concerned with being able to use my api now that i
            found an api that works well for me.
