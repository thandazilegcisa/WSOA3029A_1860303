            What is Interaction For Visualisation?
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Interaction has been an area of interest within fields such as games
            studies, Hci - community, and data visualisation. However, there has
            been much debate concerning the definition of interaction and its
            role in relation to visualisation. This is because overtime
            different fields prioritized different needs for the end user for
            different reasons. It is for this reason Dimara et al (2020) argues
            her definition from a comparative basis that aims to gauge how one
            definition reinforces or pushes an idea.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In their article, Dimara et al (2020) note and reveal what they
            consider mandatory components of interaction, namely a.) external
            and internal entities, external and internal actions. What does this
            mean? Well, central to these components are two objects, a human and
            a machine (data) this defines what they call external entities. In
            this case the user is a human being who is characterised by
            demographics, skills, abilities and motivation. This is essentially
            the "object" - person - who initiates the interaction to share a
            moment in time. In contrast Internal entities is interaction
            characterised by goal orientated activities involving
            data-orientated intent (Dimara et al 2020). On the other hand,
            actions are what mediates these two streams of entities by creating
            a dialogue between the user and the visualisation. The user performs
            an action on the system and the system returns feeback that is
            perceived by the user. Whereas internal actions are intangible
            cognitive acts of the user such as processing the data.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="aboutArticle-Header">Do i agree or disagree?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            I agree because this definition recognises the users cognitive
            functions. And as mentioned in previous articles this should be
            considered in relation to the layout and architecture of the site.
            Therefore, interaction as seen throughout the site serves as a means
            to organise and re-organise content according to the users intent.
            Interaction as seen in my interactive graphs, gives the user the
            opportunity to reveal, or change the specific data set.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Interaction for visualisation commonly involves all of these
            components. External entities involve external physical objects such
            as a mouse, pen, keyboard and physical constraints such as the
            environment under which interaction occurs. Internal entities uses
            prior knowledge to establish how a user may act such as externally
            changing the data with filtering and aggregation techniques.
            Therefore from these components we can deduce that interaction
            refers to the action reaction dialogue between the user and the
            visualisation system whereas Interactivity - which is often used
            inter changeably refers to the feel, properties and quality of the
            interaction. I agree with statement because according to (Smuts
            2008) for a product to be interactive, something must be responsive
            in a ways that is neither controllable nor completely random.
            Therefore, interactivity speaks to the experience of an interaction
            such as how it controls and challenges the user and not the
            interaction itself.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            That being said there are significant benefits for adding
            interaction to visualisations as it has been proven in contexts such
            as games to amplify inactive, human driven data exploration in which
            the user is in control of the information space. So that the user
            can have full agency over the affordances provided by the system to
            act upon their intent. Hence, it is for this reason that according
            to (Dimara et al 2020) "interaction for visualisation is the
            interplay between a person and a data interface involving
            data-related intent".
