            The History of Data Visualisation
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            This article examines the history of data visualisation and the
            history it foregrounds through pictures, dates, numeric and textual
            descriptions. According to Friendly (2008) “before the 17 century,
            data visualisations existed mainly in the realm of maps, displaying
            land marker, cities, roads, and resources”. However, as populations
            grew, the industrial revolution took place during the 19 century.

            The need to organise and plan for economies, medicine, commerce,
            transportation, and the military took priority. This gave rise to
            what has come to be known as the golden age of statistical graphing.
            And with the use of graphical displays for understanding complex
            data established, many new graphical forms of interpreting data were
            invented and extended into new areas of inquiry including the Rose
            Diagram by Florence Nightingale, which is the object of our study.
            Data, often than not, is contextual. And because data is often
            collected from a primary source, considering what the data seeks to
            represent is extremely important. By looking at what it seeks to
            represent we decode the various means of communication it signifies,
            be it text, pictures, or numbers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We do this by first establishing the context or discourse, and then
            establish the difference we seek within this context, which is
            commonly done by stacking figures on a bar graph, or in Florence
            Nightingale’s case stacking proportions on a rose diagram. In a 2016
            article Clive Thompson cites that Nightingale’s visualisation was
            foregrounded by war, a war in which she deemed not to be the cause
            of high mortality rates but rather unsanitary conditions for
            militants. Hence, her rose diagram compared the number of people
            dying from war, diseases, and other causes, and her findings found
            that more people were dying from causes unrelated to war such as
            disease. Her stark revelations and visualisations exalted her to
            become the first person to successfully use data visualisation to
            persuade and influence public policy. Because public servants
            quickly amended policy to provide healthily, and sanitary conditions
            to honour militant’s work. This visualisation was great because it
            produced form, shape, and colour to separate ideas, which rendered
            the data collected easily readable, and indeed usable.

            This form of visualisation though not quite popular in business,
            economics, and government departments. Has taken the form of a
            loading bar that certain applications use to indicate the collection
            or buffering of a website or app. Therefore, the main takeaway from
            this article is that data visualisation provides a frame of
            reference (context) within which audiences can interpret and
            differentiate information easily and clearly to persuade audiences
            to either change policy, become aware of their biases, or promote
            consumption.
