            Information is Beautiful - Gender Pay Gap
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the visualisation of the above title. The authour McCandles
            (2016) illustrates the gender pay gap between males and females
            between major geo-political alliances - The UK & US. The graph is a
            unique scatter plot graph that uses connections between dots -
            purple for female & green for males - to signify the gap between the
            two genders.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The interaction in this visualisation allows the user to follow
            their intent by providing users the option to filter or sort
            information depending on a specific category. The categories
            provided include sorting the plot either by salary - which displays
            values in dollars on the x-axis by an increment of 10 in thousands -
            or gap, which displays the pay gap in percentages. This was
            particularly helpful because it made the data very easily readable
            in terms of the core aim of the visualisation - examining "gender
            pay gaps". It gave ne the ability to sort the data and understand
            the core premise of why the visualisation was made.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            And because the plot by gap is very readable, it appeals much more
            to the emotional response one might get by interacting with the data
            in this way. By so doing it kept me motivated to explore the other
            options that interaction provided, including sorting the job
            category on the x-axis by either the default orientation of job
            categories, or in descending or ascending order. This allowed me to
            easily be able summarise as to which job occupations have the
            largest or least pay gap - Legal occupations. This was intresting to
            find out but yet not suprising cause followed by Legal occupations
            is Doctors, Chief Executives, Financial Advisors, and Construction
            workers these jobs have endured privileges of status within
            communities with children being urged to work in these industries.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Whereas, when i sorted the plot by salaries with the narrowest gap,
            you learn that occupations with the narrowest gap are the least
            desired jobs within society like bus driving, social working,
            security workers,and office clerks. Thus, the sorting interactions
            afforded us gave me agency to sort of create an interactive
            narrative driven by my intent. As such by means of these
            interactions i was able to ultimately conclude that the US
            particularly has a higher gender pay gap by changing the data set
            examined to the UK which fairs well in illustrating that women in
            some sectors of the UK economy earn more than men. This is
            encouraging and potentially shows which country has better work
            place policies that consider the needs of women and their role in
            the economy because not only are there considerably low pay gaps in
            "discouraged jobs" but also those that have the privilege of status.
