              What is Data Visualisation?

            Imagine a universal library filled with every book that is and ‘not’
            in existence, deemed into existence by discovery. This is what the
            internet personifies. And with all that there is to discover on the
            internet data visualisation has significantly localised invention
            and discovery throughout the internet.
            <br />
            <br />
            The development of the internet and computer software as Li (2020)
            rightly points out, “has advanced the application of data
            visualisation, allowing users to manipulate a substantial amount of
            data for exploration and analysis more easily and affordably”. This
            means that the aim of using images to gain insights and knowledge
            from discovering data and its patterns and relationships can be
            achieved. This is extremely important because the far-reaching
            impact of the science behind how data is collected, linked, and
            created on the internet necessitates pictorial or graphical
            interfacing to present, contextualise, and give data meaning.
            <br />
            <br />
            An example of data visualised are infographics. According to the
            Oxford English Dictionary, an infographic is “a visual
            representation of information or data”. Infographics help audiences
            understand and remember the content of the infographic. My first
            encounter with infographics was on pamphlets, flyers, and brochures.
            And from this, it is clear that infographics are meant to readily
            provide an easily readable, and quick rundown of something that
            would be difficult to explain in the moment from a promoter (because
            you are in a rush to go to work) for example.
            <br />
            <br />Infographics often contain text, images to represent their
            intent, but data visualisation in its traditional form is
            represented with trees, charts, diagrams, and graphs. These are
            common ways of visualising data that is largely understood to
            co-relate, differentiate, and compare data. Because ultimately what
            data visualisation seeks to do is build perception, invite opinion,
            and cultivate knowledge. In conclusion, the lesson that can be
            learned from this article is that data visualisation is a need.
            Because humans navigate lives through meaningful means of
            forecasting events based on co-relating, differentiating, and
            comparing data as means to understand the context we live in.
            Therefore, through this newfound understanding of how information
            can be organised and subsequently interpreted it is apparent that
            data visualisation creates and enables storytelling and narrative.
