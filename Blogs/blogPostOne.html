              What is Data Visualisation?
            </h2>

          <br />
          <p>
            Imagine a universal library filled with every book that is and ‘not’
            in existence, deemed into existence by discovery. This is what the
            internet personifies. And with all that there is to discover on the
            internet data visualisation has significantly localised invention
            and discovery throughout the internet.
            <br />
            <br />
            The development of the internet and computer software as Li (2020)
            rightly points out, “has advanced the application of data
            visualisation, allowing users to manipulate a substantial amount of
            data for exploration and analysis more easily and affordably”. This
            means that the aim of using images to gain insights and knowledge
            from discovering data and its patterns and relationships can be
            achieved. This is extremely important because the far-reaching
            impact of the science behind how data is collected, linked, and
            created on the internet necessitates pictorial or graphical
            interfacing to present, contextualise, and give data meaning.
            <br />
            <br>
            <h3 class="aboutArticle-Header">How is this reflected in my site?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Well this is personified through the types of graphs that are present within the 
              site, because these graphs use shapes and text to communicate the information
              outlayed by the data. However, some of the graphs present in the website provide the user with
              buttons to manipulate and change the data set that they wish to examine. 
            </p>

            <br />
            <p> An example of data visualised are infographics. According to the
              Oxford English Dictionary, an infographic is “a visual
              representation of information or data”. Infographics help audiences
              understand and remember the content of the infographic. My first
              encounter with infographics was on pamphlets, flyers, and brochures.
              And from this, it is clear that infographics are meant to readily
              provide an easily readable, and quick rundown of something that
              would be difficult to explain in the moment from a promoter (because
              you are in a rush to go to work) for example.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 class="aboutArticle-Header">What is my Opinion on them?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              I find infographics particularly effective in conveying a significant 
              amount of information in a very effective way. Their use of text and 
              visuals often sometimes remind me about comics, and how the use of 
              these two mediums encapsulate a multimodal motif that contextualises
              the reasons behind and the inforgraphic through its visuals and reinforces 
              the meaning and message through text - much like comics do.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="aboutArticle-Header">Does this make sense?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Yes, Infographics often contain text, images to represent their
              intent, but data visualisation in its traditional form is
              represented with trees, charts, diagrams, and graphs. These are
              common ways of visualising data that is largely understood to
              co-relate, differentiate, and compare data. Because ultimately what
              data visualisation seeks to do is build perception, invite opinion,
              and cultivate knowledge. In conclusion, the lesson that can be
              learned from this article is that data visualisation is a need.
              Because humans navigate lives through meaningful means of
              forecasting events based on co-relating, differentiating, and
              comparing data as means to understand the context we live in.
              Therefore, through this newfound understanding of how information
              can be organised and subsequently interpreted it is apparent that
              data visualisation creates and enables storytelling and narrative. </p>
