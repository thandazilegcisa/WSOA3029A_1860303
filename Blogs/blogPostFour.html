            Dissecting Model Visuals
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Webpages are reproductions of early forms of gathering, organising,
            and distributing data such as literature, news media, and other
            forms of print media. It is for this reason that website are
            synonymously referred to web pages. Therefore, it is no surprise
            that for websites to effectively perform their intended work,
            they’ve borrowed conventions from print media. Particularly with
            regards to the way that users scan or read or visualise webpages.

            According to (Knafflic 2015), a user’s eyes are drawn first to the
            top left of a page. Therefore, it is important to consider this to
            be able to establish certain strategies that will determine what is
            emphasised or de-emphasised on the page. As developers we are often
            on a mission to create for the user (user-centric design) and in
            doing so developers often create a visual hierarchy in which certain
            elements within the page are allocated a specific level of priority
            represented through the use of colour, scale, and proportion. This
            is important because a user’s priority is always ease of access and
            by establishing a visual hierarchy that they can follow removes any
            clutter that might obstruct their user experience of a webpage.

          <p>
            Therefore, it is important to consider how the use or otherwise,
            affect the user experience of a page because establishing a visual
            hierarchy determines how the information architecture of the site is
            perceived and understood, and at the end of the day engages users
            because they can attribute their attention to a specific focal point
            on the page. This will be very useful in considering how I can make
            my data set easy to understand and fun to consume because we make
            data visualisations to intrigue them in to getting to know about the
            data, but how we arrange and choose to design our visual hierarchy
            on the graphs we can not only intrigue users with visuals but engage
            with them.
