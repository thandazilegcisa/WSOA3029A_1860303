            The use of API's (Application Programming Interfaces) has
            democratised data and its potential uses. This has had a profound
            impact on the field of information visualisation. The ability to
            create visual representations of data on computers and not only
            reproduce visualisation but expand of the concept has defined this
            use of data as its own art practice. This is Particularly
            interesting because data visualisation is meant to tell a story and
            by adopting this as an artistic practice could engage people in
            emotional-moral reflection of the information that is presented to
            them. Which means users are more likely to be persuaded and engaged
            through such means.

            Artistic visualistaions are visualisations of data done by artists
            with the intent of making art. Intent is very important here because
            that is the essence of what guides the user as to what storyline is
            being followed and why. Therefore intent gives meaning to the
            visualisation of data from a perspective that recognizes the power
            of visualisation to express a point of view. Hence, Visualisations
            can be used to persuade and to analyse.
