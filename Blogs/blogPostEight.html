            Artistic Data Visualisation
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The use of API's (Application Programming Interfaces) has
            democratised data and its potential uses. This has had a profound
            impact on the field of information visualisation. The ability to
            create visual representations of data on computers and not only
            reproduce visualisation but expand of the concept has defined this
            use of data as its own art practice. This is Particularly
            interesting because data visualisation is meant to tell a story and
            by adopting this as an artistic practice could engage people in
            emotional-moral reflection of the information that is presented to
            them. Which means users are more likely to be persuaded and engaged
            through such means.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Artistic visualistaions are visualisations of data done by artists
            with the intent of making art. Intent is very important here because
            that is the essence of what guides the user as to what storyline is
            being followed, for example intent also governs the how potential
            interactions with this webpage might happen - my navigation guides
            the users intent. Therefore intent gives meaning and contextualises
            the visualisation of data from a perspective in which the human
            recognizes the power of visualisation to express a point of view.
            Hence,is for this reason that visualisations can be used to persuade
            and to analyse.

            Now, because artworks are aesthetic and engross aesthetic pleasures
            that affect emotional responses. It brings the user-human closer to
            the reality behind the source of data, therefore encapsulating and
            affective experience by making the data seemingly tangible. Which is
            why with this project aims to use storytelling - albeit with text
            (instead of visual art or auditory art as in my data driven artwork
            example), data and interaction contexualised through the site.
