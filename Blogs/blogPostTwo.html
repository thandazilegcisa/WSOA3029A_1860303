              Analysis of Twitch

          <p>
            The structure, architecture, or layout of a website is no trivial
            practice. It is important because it is how information is accessed
            and sequenced. Hence, the structure and layout of a website serve to
            convey the information architecture of a website. To display the
            possibilities of navigating through an application. And in the case
            of Twitch – our chosen case study, its user interface and user
            experience speak to exactly that. Mainly because Twitch understands
            the context of its medium, and thus follows several conventions that
            have partly framed how the layout and structure of its website are
            understood to be.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="aboutArticle-Header">How does this relate to my site?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Well, the architecture of my site is a result of the specifications
            that were needed for the site, this includes a landing page, a blogs
            page, an about page, and a data visualisation page. And each and
            every link in the website informs the user about the possibilities
            of what can be explored throughout the site.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Considering the real estate of a website is very important. And in
            the image (screenshot of twitch), above we see that although a lot
            of information is presented to the user i.e. the scale of how images
            and text is presented follows a hierarchy. The logo in the top left
            corner establishes or reinforces the colour palette of the website
            and is placed at this position to meet user’s needs because users
            have already adopted presumptions and conventions about how
            information is presented on the web, thus much of the design of
            Twitch is user-centric. I say this because, for one, the search bar
            calls the user to action to search/browse for channels that they
            could watch to convert the user into browsing the architecture of
            the app. And this visual motif or hierarchy is maintained through
            the site because functions that aid the discovery of channels is
            prioritised, even though just the font-weight. For example, the
            names, and messages of users use a different font size compared to
            the streamers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="aboutArticle-Header">How does this affect my website?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Well, the key word that to be noted from this article is
            <strong>convention</strong>
            What is convention? - In simple terms convention is a
            pre-established way of doing something in a specific medium. And in
            my websites case, it makes use of a number of conventions to
            contextualise the hierarchy of information in the site, for instance
            text is written and read from left to right, or the navigation is on
            top of the site.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Why is the font size different? This is mainly because the streamers
            represent Twitch, they contextualise the app as what it is – a video
            streaming site, which gives meaning to the platform. This is also
            the reason why the video screen is the main focal point of the site.
            Additionally, Twitch has very interesting user experience features,
            including The Hype Train. This is when users of the app subscribe to
            a streamers channel, and when multiple users accumulate
            subscriptions over a short space of time it creates a hype train.
            This is interesting because it invites users to support the
            streamers and subsequently the platform. Though this is not the only
            way this goal is achieved. It is also achieved by creating a badge
            or leader board for a user who gifts the most subscriptions or
            emotes that streamers curate to use in their channel.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Though this might be a bias interpretation of what the colour red
            means within the website, the colour red is easily readable and
            draws attention because it carries weight, and as such it is used to
            bring attention to important notifications and stats for users such
            as the number of viewers watching, and if a broadcast is live or
            not. So, what can be learnt from this modest analysis is that
            conventions do most of the work for the developer especially with
            regards to usability and accessibility because of an established
            understanding of how user interfaces are structured on the web. And
            that the visual hierarchy of how information is subsequently as the
            structure itself because it seeks to interpret the structure by
            giving it colour, size, density, and value.
