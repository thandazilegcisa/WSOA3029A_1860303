            The structure, architecture, or layout of a website is no trivial
            practice. It is important because it is how information is accessed
            and sequenced. Hence, the structure and layout of a website serve to
            convey the information architecture of a website. To display the
            possibilities of navigating through an application. And in the case
            of Twitch – our chosen case study, its user interface and user
            experience speak to exactly that. Mainly because Twitch understands
            the context of its medium, and thus follows several conventions that
            have partly framed how the layout and structure of its website are
            understood to be.

            Considering the real estate of a website is very important. And in
            the image, above we see that although a lot of information is
            presented to the user the scale of how images and text is presented
            follows a hierarchy. The logo in the top left corner establishes or
            reinforces the colour palette of the website and is placed at this
            position to meet user’s needs because users have already adopted
            presumptions and conventions about how information is presented on
            the web, thus much of the design of Twitch is user-centric. I say
            this because, for one, the search bar calls the user to action to
            search/browse for channels that they could watch to convert the user
            into browsing the architecture of the app. And this visual motif or
            hierarchy is maintained through the site because functions that aid
            the discovery of channels is prioritised, even though just the
            font-weight. For example, the names, and messages of users use a
            different font size compared to the streamers.

            This is mainly because the streamers represent Twitch, they
            contextualise the app as what it is – a video streaming site, which
            gives meaning to the platform. This is also the reason why the video
            screen is the main focal point of the site. Additionally, Twitch has
            very interesting user experience features, including The Hype Train.
            This is when users of the app subscribe to a streamers channel, and
            when multiple users accumulate subscriptions over a short space of
            time it creates a hype train. This is interesting because it invites
            users to support the streamers and subsequently the platform. Though
            this is not the only way this goal is achieved. It is also achieved
            by creating a badge or leader board for a user who gifts the most
            subscriptions or emotes that streamers curate to use in their
            channel.

            Though this might be a bias interpretation of what the colour red
            means within the website, the colour red is easily readable and
            draws attention because it carries weight, and as such it is used to
            bring attention to important notifications and stats for users such
            as the number of viewers watching, and if a broadcast is live or
            not. So, what can be learnt from this modest analysis is that
            conventions do most of the work for the developer especially with
            regards to usability and accessibility because of an established
            understanding of how user interfaces are structured on the web. And
            that the visual hierarchy of how information is subsequently as the
            structure itself because it seeks to interpret the structure by
            giving it colour, size, density, and value.
