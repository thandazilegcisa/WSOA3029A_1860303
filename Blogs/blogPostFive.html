            Information is Beautiful - What can we do to reduce emissions?
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            This article examines the representational and communication
            strategies used in the visualisation of the above title. The overall
            aim of the visualisation is to aquaint users with the various ways
            in which every human on planet earth can play a role in reducing the
            amount of greenhouse gases causing global warming.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This visualisation takes the style of a visual infographic that not
            only communicates with graphs, but with text and pictographs that
            make up the iconography of what the text refers to. In this
            visualisation the colour palette is used to enhance meaning by using
            colour to either foreground or background specific information on
            the screen. What is particularly interesting about this
            visualisation is that it indicates the current yearly average of
            golabl emissions per person in a particular country. And what this
            does is that by indicating which persons, from a sepcific country
            are close to the current average it highlights who - which countries
            citizens - still need to do more in order to fight global warming.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This visualisation is very provocative because it is very personal,
            it does not necessary frame the conversation around countries/cities
            like my current project. Instead it puts the onus on an individual
            by informing readers about what they can do in their daily lives to
            reduce co2 emissions. This includes things such as, leaving the car
            at home, instead choosing to take a walk, bike, or train. Taking
            fewer flights, buying green energy, plant a tree, reduced food wast.
            By so doing the visualisation not only gives people solutions, but
            also highlights some of the biggest contributing factors without
            needing to have an individual graph for such factors.
