            Information is Beautiful - What can we do to reduce emissions?
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            This article examines the representational and communication
            strategies used in the visualization of the above title. The overall
            aim of the visualization is to enlighten users with the various ways
            in which every human on planet earth can play a role in reducing the
            amount of greenhouse gases causing global warming.
          </p>

            This visualisation takes the style of a visual info-graphic that not
            only communicates with graphs, but with text and pictographs that
            make up the iconography of what the text refers to. In this
            visualisation the colour palette is used to enhance meaning by using
            colour to either foreground or background specific information on
            the screen. What is particularly interesting about this
            visualisation is that it indicates the yearly average of global
            emissions per person in a particular country. And what this does is
            that by indicating which persons, from a specific country are close
            to the current average it examines who - as in which countries
            citizens - still need to do more in order to fight global warming.

            Well, this article provides very valuable insights into what causes
            global warming, focuses on how an individual can contribute to
            global warming. This influenced my approach in deciding on i would
            approach my exam graph. Therefore, in light of becoming conscious of
            what practices contribute to global warming i wanted measure the air
            quality of various cities across the world in relation to their
            population.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This visualisation is very provocative because it is very personal,
            it does not necessary frame the conversation around countries/cities
            like my current project, although since i've added a new graph
            contextualizing the demographics if each city. By so doing it
            reinforces the intent of this visualisation by framing and putting
            the onus on an individual to inform themselves about what they can
            do in their daily lives to reduce co2 emissions. The list includes
            practices such as, leaving the car at home, instead choosing to take
            a walk, bike, or train. Taking fewer flights, buying green energy,
            plant a tree, reduced food wast. By so doing the visualisation not
            only gives people solutions, but also highlights some of the biggest
            contributing factors without needing to have an individual graph for
            such factors.
