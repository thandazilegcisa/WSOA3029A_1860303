            The Weather Score Project
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The weather score project is an amalgamation of data driven art work
            that makes use of not only visuals but auditory compositions of the
            assimilation of data. It is a project that is entirely based on
            weather data, which is then adapted by composers to a musical
            performance. "These musical performances have taken place in a
            variety of venues from galleries, concert halls to theaters and
            planetariums".
          </p>

            What is particularly stunning about this project is that there are
            multiple strategies used in order to create the object. According to
            Miebach (2011) her she sources data from both primary and secondary
            sources. Firstly, she gathers data from her own environment without
            any cost heavy hardware, just common weather measurement units that
            one can get from a store. Then, she gathers data from secondary
            sources like satellite readings and then compiles and compares the
            data set and eventually uses the data to determine the form of her
            sculpture. On its surface, the sculpture is made up of a vertical
            and horizontal axis's that can be "tabulated" into different values
            that pertain to the humidity, temperature, or wind direction.

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            Miebach not only uses visuals for her data driven art but musical
            scores which according to her "allows for a more nuanced way of
            translating information without compromising it". Her saying this is
            interesting because weather patterns are cyclical patterns that
            resemble the change in time. And so because audio/and music is
            temporal. Visual art more so contextualises space & and
            environments. Therefore, i understand why she would make such a
            statement.

            Whats striking about this work is that it welcomes emotional
            responses that come from different perspectives. This therefore,
            welcomes and emphasises critical thinking about weather patterns
            that comes from an emotional experience of either a.) seeing the
            project in an art museum as a sculpture or b.) seeing the project in
            a science museum as a 3D visualisation of data or lastly c.) as a
            Musical in the form of a musical score. By so doing the project
            renders weather Visible, Tactile and Musical.
