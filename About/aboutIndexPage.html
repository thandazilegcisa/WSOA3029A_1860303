            This project aims to use the Air Quality Open Data Api to examine
            and objectively determine which places around the world have the
            best or worst air quality n. As such the core aim of this is to tell a
            story as to the potential reasons why a city or place may or may not
            have good air quality (as in the case of using a new data set, that includes the population data of the cities examined).
            Consequently this also drives the narrative that the world is changing and we (humans) are catalysts or agents
            of that change either good or bad. Therefore, the main point of difference that will be used to derive this
            narrative includes assimilating the air quality index and population data of a given
            city. Using the D3.js library.

          <br />
          <p>
            Considering the fact that I now have a solid understanding of
            HTML,CSS,javascript. And knowing that my website last semester was
            simplistic and did not make much use of color. I made it a point
            that i establish the tone, feel, colour palette and some of the
            experience first, before i handled all my data. So that i can focus
            my attention on that for the remainder of the project instead of
            styling, but rather the data and how a user interacts with it.

          <p>
            This is probably the only thing that i am not particularly happy about when it comes to
            the site. The site is responsive for large screens and not necessary for smaller screens.
            This is a failure on my part with regards to the css and subsequently media queries throughout the site.
            Because i worked on the majority of the Responsiveness of the site in one css file, i eventually
            became confused and unconciously overwrote a significant amount of the css that deals with the Responsiveness of the site, Which resulted
            in a lot of wasted time, because i also chose to do this last. Therefore, this is why the responsiveness of the site 
            is not ideal. And in the future i plan on separating my concerns more effectively so that each html page has its own css page.

          <br />
          <p>
            The Color palette, is something that i took quiet seriously because
            although i wanted colour for this project i wanted a low saturation
            "muted" looking colours. And upon Reflection it was a good move
            because it still gives me room to add pictures most of which could
            be highly saturated as most comic books are.
