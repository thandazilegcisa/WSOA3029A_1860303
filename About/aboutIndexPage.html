            This project aims to use the Air Quality Open Data Api to examine
            and objectively determine which places around the world have the
            best or worst air quality. As such the core aim of this is to tell a
            story as to the potential reasons why a city or place may or may not
            have good air quality. Consequently this also drives the narrative
            that the world is changing and we (humans) are catalysts or agents
            of that change either good or bad.

            The main point of difference that will be used to derive this
            narrative includes assimilating the air quality index of a given
            city. Using the D3.js library. I plan on working more on the
            creative component of the project now that i've established a
            narrative and have my requests being heard.

            Considering the fact that I now have a solid understanding of
            HTML,CSS,javascript. And knowing that my website last semester was
            simplistic and did not make much use of color. I made it a point
            that i establish the tone, feel, colour palette and some of the
            experience first, before i handled all my data. So that i can focus
            my attention on that for the remainder of the project instead of
            styling, but rather the data and how a user interacts with it.

            The Color palette, is something that i took quiet seriously because
            although i wanted colour for this project i wanted a low saturation
            "muted" looking colours. And upon Reflection it was a good move
            because it still gives me room to add pictures most of which could
            be highly saturated as most comic books are.
