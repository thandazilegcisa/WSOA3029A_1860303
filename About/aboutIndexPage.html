            This project aims to use a Superhero Api to examine and objectively
            construct a valid premise. With which fandoms from the Marvel
            Universe and DC Universe can whole heartedly exclaim which Universe
            is the best and why.
          </p>

            The main point of difference that will be used to derive this
            narrative includes assimilating the powerstats of a given character
            or set of characters within the universe (e.g. The Avenvgers in
            comparison to the Justice League). Using the D3.js library. The
            visualistion of such data serves as an effective way of
            communicating seeing that comics are also a visual medium therefore,
            this is meant to provide quick resolutions to any debate that you
            might have with a friend or family member regarding the two comic
            giants.

            I have always been of the opinion that the DC universe's characters
            have more flare, depth, and far more interesting biographies that
            enable the characters to build sentiment and be loved by more than
            just kids (which is the assumed target market for comics) but adults
            too. So, coming across this api has given me the opportunity to
            interrogate as to whether or not what i've believed to be true for
            so long is in fact true. Hence, the data that will be used will
            present narratives (data) designed to persuade the user into coming
            to an objective agreement as to which Universe is the best.

          <br />
          <p>
            Considering the fact that I now have a solid understanding of
            HTML,CSS,javascript. And knowing that my website last semester was
            simplistic and did not make much use of color. I made it a point
            that i establish the tone, feel, colour palette and some of the
            experience first, before i handled all my data. So that i can focus
            my attention on that for the remainder of the project instead of
            styling, but rather the data and how a user interacts with it.

          <p>
            The Color palette, is something that i took quiet seriously because
            although i wanted colour for this project i wanted a low saturation
            "muted" looking colours. And upon Reflection it was a good move
            because it still gives me room to add pictures most of which could
            be highly saturated as most comic books are.
